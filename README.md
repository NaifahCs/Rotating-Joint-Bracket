# Rotating-Joint-Bracket
This project includes a 3D model of a rotating joint bracket designed using Onshape, ideal for use in robotic arms or mechanical linkages


# Files Included

- `Part Studio 1.sldprt` SolidWorks source part file
  
- `Part Studio 1.stl`  3D printable STL version of the bracket
  

# ⚙️ How It Works

The bracket:
- Acts as a **rotational joint** in robotic or mechanical systems
  
- Has two vertical arms with side holes for an axle, pin, or servo shaft
  
- Includes bottom holes for stable base mounting
  
- Provides a U-shaped frame for flexibility in joint motion
  

Designed using Onshape , this part supports applications like rotating robotic arms or pan-tilt mechanisms
